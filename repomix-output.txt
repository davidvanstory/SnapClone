# Project Name
ArtCritique AI: Solo Tutor

## Project Description
An ephemeral, low-stakes mobile application for art students and hobbyists to build confidence. This project focuses on adding a **private, AI-powered "Solo Tutor"** to the existing app. This feature provides a one-on-one chat interface where a user can get personalized guidance on their art. The tutor uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to learn from the user's private chat history, offering contextual, evolving feedback that acts as a dedicated art coach.

## Target Audience
- **Primary Persona (Alex):** A busy working professional (30s) new to art. He uses the existing **Class Feed** for low-stakes peer interaction and the new **Solo Tutor** for private, in-depth learning, asking questions, and building confidence without judgment.

## Desired Features
### Core App Structure & Navigation
- [ ] A new "Solo" tab will be added to the main tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
- [ ] This tab will navigate to a new `app/(tabs)/solo.tsx` screen, which will host the AI chat interface.

### AI-Powered Solo Tutor (New Feature)
- [ ] **Chat Interface:**
    - [ ] The "Solo Feed" will be a single, continuous chat log.
    - [ ] Users can initiate conversation by sending a text-only message or by uploading an image with an accompanying text prompt.
    - [ ] A loading indicator will be displayed while the AI is generating a response.
- [ ] **Multimodal AI Interaction:**
    - [ ] The AI tutor will use a multimodal model like **OpenAI's GPT-4o** to analyze user-uploaded images.
    - [ ] **Image Upload Workflow:** When a user uploads an image, the app will first upload the file to Supabase Storage. This is a standard industry practice that provides a secure, permanent URL for the media file, which is then used in the API call to the AI.

### Backend & RAG Implementation
- [ ] **Database Schema (Supabase):**
    - [ ] A new Supabase migration will be created to add the following tables. The `pgvector` extension must be enabled in Supabase to support the `vector` type.

      ```sql
      -- Table to act as a container for each conversation thread
      CREATE TABLE solo_ai_chats (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
          user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          title TEXT, -- A user-definable title for the chat, e.g., "Hand Study Feedback"
          created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
          updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
      );

      -- Table to store every individual message within a chat
      CREATE TABLE solo_ai_messages (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
          chat_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES solo_ai_chats(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')), -- Distinguishes who sent the message
          content TEXT NOT NULL, -- The text of the message
          image_url TEXT, -- Optional URL for an image associated with the message
          embedding vector(1536), -- Stores the text embedding for RAG. Dimension 1536 matches 'text-embedding-3-small'
          created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
      );
      ```
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering Strategy:**
    - [ ] A detailed **System Prompt** will be designed to instruct the AI on its persona ('Canvas', a supportive tutor). It will also instruct the AI to use specific art terminology (e.g., 'composition', 'shading', 'perspective') to ensure its responses are not only helpful to the user but also generate rich text content that is ideal for creating powerful embeddings for RAG.
- [ ] **Supabase Edge Function (`get-ai-response`):**
    - [ ] This function will contain the complete, self-contained RAG logic:
        1.  **Receive Request:** The function is triggered with the user's new prompt, the `chat_id`, and an optional `image_url`.
        2.  **Generate Query Embedding:** Call the **OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model** to convert the user's new text prompt into a vector embedding.
        3.  **Retrieve Relevant History (Long-Term Memory):** Use the newly generated embedding to perform a vector similarity search within the `solo_ai_messages` table. This search will query the embeddings of **both past user questions and past AI answers**, ensuring the most contextually relevant information is found.
        4.  **Retrieve Recent Conversation (Short-Term Memory):** Fetch the last 4-6 messages from the current `chat_id` to maintain the immediate conversational flow.
        5.  **Augment the Prompt:** Construct a final, enhanced prompt for the LLM. This prompt will include the user's current question, the *retrieved historical messages*, and the *recent conversation messages*.
        6.  **Generate Response (Multimodal Step):** Send the augmented prompt (and the `image_url`, if provided) to the **OpenAI `GPT-4o` API**.
        7.  **Persist Both Sides of the Conversation:** After receiving the AI's response, the function will perform two `INSERT` operations into the `solo_ai_messages` table:
            - **First, save the user's message:** Create a row with `role: 'user'`, the user's text, and a newly generated embedding for that text.
            - **Second, save the AI's response:** Create a row with `role: 'assistant'`, the AI's response text, and another newly generated embedding for the AI's response. This ensures the AI's advice becomes part of its long-term memory. This includes calling the `text-embedding-3-small` model again to create and store a new embedding for each message.

### Synthetic Demo Data
- [ ] A new `seed.sql` script will be created to populate the Solo Tutor with a rich, **five-chat history** for a demo user ("Alex").
- [ ] The synthetic chats will cover a range of topics (e.g., hand proportions, perspective, color theory, composition) and will be structured to build on each other, allowing a demo to compellingly showcase the RAG system's "memory."
- [ ] The seed script must include pre-computed embeddings for the synthetic messages.

## Design Requests
- [ ] **Tab Bar:** The bottom tab bar will contain three items: "Class Feed," "Camera," and "Solo Feed."
- [ ] **Solo Tutor Chat UI:**
    - [ ] The chat interface should reuse existing components (`GlassMorphismCard`, `ThemedText`).
    - [ ] Chat bubbles for the user and AI should be clearly distinguishable (e.g., right-aligned for the user, left-aligned for the AI).
    - [ ] When an image is part of a message, it should be displayed in a card format within the chat log, **not** as a full-screen background.
- [ ] **Chat Input Area:**
    - [ ] The text input field at the bottom of the screen will be contained within a glass morphism card.
    - [ ] This card will also feature a distinct, tappable icon to **upload a picture** from the user's gallery. The "take a picture" option will be omitted from the chat UI to keep it clean.

## Other Notes
- **Technology Stack Clarification:** Embeddings will be **created** by the `OpenAI text-embedding-3-small` model. They will be **stored and searched** within Supabase using the `pgvector` extension.
- **Future RAG Enhancements:** While the MVP uses text-based RAG, the architecture is designed to potentially incorporate multimodal embedding models like CLIP in the future.
- **Error Handling:** The chat UI must gracefully handle potential API errors from OpenAI or the Edge Function, displaying a user-friendly message.

- Simple user profiles with usernames and avatars

#### Group Management
- Create groups by selecting 3-4 fake users from pre-populated list
- Simple group messaging interface
- Group member management

#### Text-to-Image Generation
- Text prompt input interface with character limits
- Categorized AI prompt suggestion system:
  - **Style-based**: "photorealistic", "cartoon style", "oil painting", "anime"
  - **Mood-based**: "epic fantasy", "cozy atmosphere", "dramatic lighting"
  - **Subject-based**: "cute animals", "space scenes", "food photography"
- Custom prompt text input with helpful tips
- Replicate API integration with google/imagen-4 for text-to-image generation
- Real-time processing status updates via Supabase Realtime
- Processing completion required before sending

#### Messaging & Sharing
- Group video sharing (transformed videos only)
- 24-hour automatic content deletion
- Processing status indicators
- Basic video viewing interface

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Pre-populated fake users
users (id, username, avatar_url, created_at)

-- Group management
groups (id, name, created_by, created_at)
group_members (group_id, user_id, joined_at)

-- Prompt templates
prompt_templates (id, category, title, prompt, popularity)

-- Text prompt messages with image generation status
text_messages (
  id, user_id, group_id, 
  text_prompt, generated_image_url,
  status, created_at, expires_at
)
```

### Processing Flow

1. User creates text prompt using input interface or selects from suggestions
2. User selects or customizes prompt categories and styles
3. Text prompt processed by Replicate API (google/imagen-4) via Supabase Edge Function
4. Real-time status updates provided to user during processing (5-15 seconds)
5. Completed AI-generated image sent to group members
6. Generated images automatically deleted after 24 hours

## Design Requirements

### User Experience
- **Playful, humorous UI personality** that matches the creative, entertaining nature of the app
- **Seamless prompt creation workflow** from text input to generation to sending
- **Clear processing state indicators** to manage user expectations during AI transformation
- **Mobile-first responsive design** optimized for smartphone usage
- **Simple group creation interface** for easy fake user selection

### Key Screens
1. **Authentication Screen**: Simple login/signup via Supabase
2. **Group Selection/Creation**: Browse and create groups with fake users
3. **Text Prompt Input**: Text creation interface with suggestions
4. **Style Selection**: Categorized style and mood options
5. **Processing Status**: Real-time progress indicator for image generation
6. **Group Chat**: View received AI-generated images
7. **Settings**: Basic user preferences

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Text-to-image generation: 5-15 seconds typical (handled by Replicate google/imagen-4)
- Image download: Sub-3 second response times
- Real-time updates: Immediate status notifications via Supabase Realtime
- Storage: Automatic cleanup of expired content

### Cost Estimation
- Replicate API: ~$0.01-0.05 per image generation (very affordable)
- Supabase: Generous free tier for prototype/testing
- Storage: Minimal due to 24-hour ephemeral nature

### Scalability Notes
- Template app approach with fake users eliminates user acquisition complexity
- Supabase handles infrastructure scaling automatically
- Replicate API manages AI model scaling and availability

# Project Name
ArtCritique AI: Solo Tutor

## Project Description
An ephemeral, low-stakes mobile application for art students and hobbyists to build confidence. This project focuses on adding a **private, AI-powered "Solo Tutor"** to the existing app. This feature provides a one-on-one chat interface where a user can get personalized guidance on their art. The tutor uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to learn from the user's private chat history, offering contextual, evolving feedback that acts as a dedicated art coach.

## Target Audience
- **Primary Persona (Alex):** A busy working professional (30s) new to art. He uses the existing **Class Feed** for low-stakes peer interaction and the new **Solo Tutor** for private, in-depth learning, asking questions, and building confidence without judgment.

## Desired Features
### Core App Structure & Navigation
- [ ] A new "Solo" tab will be added to the main tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
- [ ] This tab will navigate to a new `app/(tabs)/solo.tsx` screen, which will host the AI chat interface.

### AI-Powered Solo Tutor (New Feature)
- [ ] **Chat Interface:**
    - [ ] The "Solo Feed" will be a single, continuous chat log.
    - [ ] Users can initiate conversation by sending a text-only message or by uploading an image with an accompanying text prompt.
    - [ ] A loading indicator will be displayed while the AI is generating a response.
- [ ] **Multimodal AI Interaction:**
    - [ ] The AI tutor must be able to analyze user-uploaded images. This will be implemented using a multimodal model like **OpenAI's GPT-4o**.
    - [ ] **Image Upload Workflow:** When a user uploads an image in the chat, the app will first upload the file to Supabase Storage. This is a standard industry practice that provides a secure, permanent URL for the media file, which is then used for the API call.

### Backend & RAG Implementation
- [ ] **Database Schema (Supabase):**
    - [ ] Create a new Supabase migration to add two tables:
        - [ ] **`solo_ai_chats`**: Acts as a container for each conversation thread (Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `title`).
        - [ ] **`solo_ai_messages`**: Stores every message bubble (Columns: `id`, `chat_id`, `role`, `content`, `image_url` (nullable), `embedding`).
    - [ ] The `solo_ai_messages.embedding` column will be of type `vector` and will utilize the `pgvector` extension.
- [ ] **RAG on Textual Analysis (MVP Strategy):**
    - [ ] For the MVP, RAG will be performed on the **text content** of the conversation (user prompts and the AI's textual analysis of images). Image data itself will not be converted into vectors for retrieval.
    - [ ] When an image is analyzed, the AI's rich textual feedback is converted to a text embedding and stored for future retrieval.
- [ ] **Supabase Edge Function (`get-ai-response`):**
    - [ ] This function will contain the complete, self-contained RAG logic:
        1.  **Receive Request:** The function is triggered with the user's new prompt, the `chat_id`, and an optional `image_url`.
        2.  **Generate Query Embedding:** Create a text embedding from the user's new text prompt.
        3.  **Retrieve Relevant History (Long-Term Memory):** Perform a vector similarity search on the `solo_ai_messages` table to find the most relevant historical messages from the user's entire chat history.
        4.  **Retrieve Recent Conversation (Short-Term Memory):** Fetch the last 4-6 messages from the current `chat_id` to maintain the immediate conversational flow.
        5.  **Augment the Prompt:** Construct a final, enhanced prompt for the LLM. This prompt will include the user's current question, the *retrieved historical messages*, and the *recent conversation messages*.
        6.  **Generate Response (Multimodal Step):** Send the augmented prompt (and the `image_url`, if provided) to the OpenAI GPT-4o API. The model will use the text context to inform its analysis of the image.
        7.  **Persist Conversation:** After receiving the AI's response, save both the user's message and the AI's response as new rows in the `solo_ai_messages` table. This includes generating and storing a new text embedding for each message to make them retrievable in the future.

### Synthetic Demo Data
- [ ] A new `seed.sql` script will be created to populate the Solo Tutor with a rich, **five-chat history** for a demo user ("Alex").
- [ ] The synthetic chats will cover a range of topics (e.g., hand proportions, perspective basics, color theory, composition) and will be structured to build on each other, allowing a demo to compellingly showcase the RAG system's "memory" and personalization.
- [ ] The seed script must include pre-computed embeddings for the synthetic messages.

## Design Requests
- [ ] **Tab Bar:** The bottom tab bar will contain three items: "Class Feed," "Camera," and "Solo Feed," maintaining consistency with the current app structure.
- [ ] **Solo Tutor Chat UI:**
    - [ ] The chat interface should reuse existing components (`GlassMorphismCard`, `ThemedText`).
    - [ ] Chat bubbles for the user and AI should be clearly distinguishable (e.g., right-aligned for the user, left-aligned for the AI).
    - [ ] When an image is part of a message, it should be displayed in a card format within the chat log, **not** as a full-screen background.
- [ ] **Chat Input Area:**
    - [ ] The text input field at the bottom of the screen will be contained within a glass morphism card.
    - [ ] This card will also feature distinct, tappable icons for **"Take a Picture"** and **"Upload a Picture"**.

## Other Notes
- **Key Technical Decision:** The entire backend, including the vector database, will be handled by **Supabase** and its `pgvector` extension.
- **Future RAG Enhancements:** While the MVP uses text-based RAG, the architecture is designed to potentially incorporate multimodal embedding models like CLIP in the future for more advanced image-based retrieval.
- **Error Handling:** The chat UI must gracefully handle potential API errors from OpenAI or the Edge Function, displaying a user-friendly message.

### Backend & RAG Implementation
- [ ] **Database Schema (Supabase):**
    - [ ] A new Supabase migration will be created to add the following tables. The `pgvector` extension must be enabled in Supabase to support the `vector` type.

      ```sql
      -- Table to act as a container for each conversation thread
      CREATE TABLE solo_ai_chats (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
          user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          title TEXT, -- A user-definable title for the chat, e.g., "Hand Study Feedback"
          created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
          updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
      );

      -- Table to store every individual message within a chat
      CREATE TABLE solo_ai_messages (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
          chat_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES solo_ai_chats(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')), -- 'user' for Alex, 'assistant' for the AI
          content TEXT NOT NULL, -- The text of the message
          image_url TEXT, -- Optional URL for an image associated with the message
          embedding vector(1536), -- Stores the embedding for RAG. Dimension 1536 matches 'text-embedding-3-small'
          created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
      );
      ```
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering Strategy:**
    - [ ] A detailed **System Prompt** will be designed to instruct the AI on its persona ('Canvas', a supportive tutor). It will also instruct the AI to use specific art terminology (e.g., 'composition', 'shading', 'perspective') to ensure its responses are not only helpful to the user but also generate rich text content that is ideal for creating powerful embeddings for RAG.
- [ ] **Supabase Edge Function (`get-ai-response`):**
    - [ ] This function will contain the complete, self-contained RAG logic:
        1.  **Receive Request:** The function is triggered with the user's new prompt, the `chat_id`, and an optional `image_url`.
        2.  **Generate Query Embedding:** Call the **OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model** to convert the user's new text prompt into a vector embedding.
        3.  **Retrieve Relevant History (Long-Term Memory):** Use the newly generated embedding to perform a vector similarity search within the `solo_ai_messages` table (using `pgvector`'s capabilities) to find the most relevant historical messages.
        4.  **Retrieve Recent Conversation (Short-Term Memory):** Fetch the last 4-6 messages from the current `chat_id` to maintain the immediate conversational flow.
        5.  **Augment the Prompt:** Construct a final, enhanced prompt for the LLM. This prompt will include the user's current question, the *retrieved historical messages*, and the *recent conversation messages*.
        6.  **Generate Response (Multimodal Step):** Send the augmented prompt (and the `image_url`, if provided) to the **OpenAI `GPT-4o` API**.
        7.  **Persist Conversation:** After receiving the AI's response, save both the user's message and the AI's response as new rows in the `solo_ai_messages` table. This includes calling the `text-embedding-3-small` model again to create and store a new embedding for each message.

### Synthetic Demo Data
- [ ] A new `seed.sql` script will be created to populate the Solo Tutor with a rich, **five-chat history** for a demo user ("Alex").
- [ ] The synthetic chats will cover a range of topics (e.g., hand proportions, perspective, color theory, composition) and will be structured to build on each other, allowing a demo to compellingly showcase the RAG system's "memory."
- [ ] The seed script must include pre-computed embeddings for the synthetic messages.

## Design Requests
- [ ] **Tab Bar:** The bottom tab bar will contain three items: "Class Feed," "Camera," and "Solo Feed."
- [ ] **Solo Tutor Chat UI:**
    - [ ] The chat interface should reuse existing components (`GlassMorphismCard`, `ThemedText`).
    - [ ] Chat bubbles for the user and AI should be clearly distinguishable (e.g., right-aligned for the user, left-aligned for the AI).
    - [ ] When an image is part of a message, it should be displayed in a card format within the chat log, **not** as a full-screen background.
- [ ] **Chat Input Area:**
    - [ ] The text input field at the bottom of the screen will be contained within a glass morphism card.
    - [ ] This card will also feature a distinct, tappable icon to **upload a picture** from the user's gallery. The "take a picture" option will be omitted from the chat UI to keep it clean.

## Other Notes
- **Technology Stack Clarification:** Embeddings will be **created** by the `OpenAI text-embedding-3-small` model. They will be **stored and searched** within Supabase using the `pgvector` extension.
- **Future RAG Enhancements:** While the MVP uses text-based RAG, the architecture is designed to potentially incorporate multimodal embedding models like CLIP in the future.
- **Error Handling:** The chat UI must gracefully handle potential API errors from OpenAI or the Edge Function, displaying a user-friendly message.

# RLS Migrations & SQL Database Structure

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive database structure, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and migration strategy for the Draft (Ephemeral Art Sharing) application. The database has been designed with a **TypeScript-first, non-recursive RLS** approach to ensure security without performance issues.

## Migration Strategy

### Philosophy: Fix at Source
Rather than applying band-aid fixes, we implemented **non-recursive RLS policies from the start** in the original migration files. This approach ensures:
- Clean migration history
- No recursive policy dependencies
- Optimal performance
- Maintainable security model

### Migration Timeline

```
20250101000001_auth_tables.sql          - User authentication & profiles
20250101000002_setup_storage.sql        - Supabase Storage bucket setup
20250101000003_create_photos_table.sql  - Photo metadata storage
20250101000004_storage_policies.sql     - Storage bucket RLS policies
20250102000001_create_classes_table.sql - Classes & membership system
20250102000002_create_posts_table.sql   - Ephemeral posts & views tracking
20250102000003_create_comments_table.sql- Comments with character limits
20250102000004_create_ai_feedback_table.sql - AI feedback integration
20250102000005_demo_data_seed.sql       - Demo content for testing
20250102000009_fix_all_recursive_policies.sql - Safety net (mostly no-ops)
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### 1. `public.users`
**Purpose**: User profiles extending auth.users
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**RLS Policies**:
- `"Users can view own profile"` - Users see their own data
- `"Users can insert own profile"` - Registration support
- `"Users can update own profile"` - Profile editing
- `"Users can view other profiles"` - Social features (usernames, avatars)

#### 2. `public.classes`
**Purpose**: Art classes with join codes
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.classes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  join_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL CHECK (join_code ~ '^[A-Z0-9]{6}$'),
  description TEXT,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  max_students INTEGER DEFAULT 30,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Features**:
- Automatic 6-character join code generation
- Class capacity management
- Soft deletion via `is_active`

**RLS Policies**:
- `"Active classes are viewable by everyone"` - Public class discovery
- `"Authenticated users can create classes"` - Class creation
- `"Class creators can update their classes"` - Management by creators
- `"Class creators can delete their classes"` - Deletion by creators

#### 3. `public.class_members`
**Purpose**: User-class relationships
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.class_members (

## RLS Security Model

### Non-Recursive Approach

**Problem Solved**: Original policies created infinite recursion by querying the same tables they were protecting.

**Solution**: Simplified policies that:
1. **Avoid self-referential queries** - No table queries itself in its own policies
2. **Move complex logic to application layer** - Class membership validation in TypeScript
3. **Use direct table references only** - Simple existence checks without joins
4. **Prioritize performance over granular security** - Trust application-level validation

### Security Layers

1. **Database Level**: Basic ownership and existence checks
2. **Application Level**: Complex business logic (class membership, permissions)
3. **Storage Level**: Bucket-based access control
4. **Authentication Level**: Supabase Auth integration

### Policy Patterns

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Non-recursive, simple ownership check
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)

-- ✅ GOOD: Direct table reference without joins
USING (class_id IN (SELECT id FROM public.classes WHERE is_active = true))

-- ❌ BAD: Recursive - queries same table being protected
USING (class_id IN (SELECT class_id FROM public.class_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()))

-- ❌ BAD: Complex joins that can cause recursion
USING (post_id IN (
  SELECT p.id FROM public.posts p
  INNER JOIN public.class_members cm ON p.class_id = cm.class_id
  WHERE cm.user_id = auth.uid()
))
```

## Database Functions

### Utility Functions

1. **`generate_join_code()`** - Creates unique 6-character class codes
2. **`set_join_code()`** - Trigger function for automatic code generation
3. **`handle_updated_at()`** - Automatic timestamp updates
4. **`handle_new_user()`** - Auto-create user profiles on registration

### Post Management Functions

1. **`set_post_expiration()`** - Calculate expiration times from duration
2. **`mark_expired_posts()`** - Batch expiration processing
3. **`increment_post_view()`** - Safe view count incrementation

### Comment & AI Functions

1. **`track_comment_edit()`** - Mark comments as edited
2. **`validate_comment_content()`** - Content validation
3. **`validate_ai_feedback_request()`** - AI feedback validation
4. **`get_post_comment_count()`** - Comment counting
5. **`has_ai_feedback()`** - AI feedback existence check

## Storage Configuration

### Buckets

- **`photos`**: Public bucket for artwork images
  - 50MB file size limit
  - Supports: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
  - Public read access
  - Authenticated upload only

### Storage Policies

```sql
-- Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Photos are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public USING (bucket_id = 'photos');

-- Authenticated upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload to photos bucket" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'photos');
```

## Demo Data Structure

### Test Environment

- **Demo Class**: "Monday Drawing Fundamentals" (join code: `DRAW01`)
- **Demo Users**: Maya, Jordan, Sam, Casey, Riley (5 fake classmates)
- **Sample Posts**: 4 artwork posts with realistic timing and engagement
- **Realistic Data**: View counts, comments, AI feedback examples

### Demo Post Examples

1. **Maya's Charcoal Portrait** - Expires in 45min, 3/5 viewers
2. **Jordan's Watercolor Landscape** - Expires in 2h20m, 2/4 viewers  
3. **Sam's Pencil Hand Study** - Expires in 18min, 5/5 viewers (max)
4. **Casey's Digital Character** - Expires in 23h45m, 1/3 viewers

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy

- **Primary Keys**: All tables use UUID primary keys
- **Foreign Keys**: Indexed for join performance
- **Query Patterns**: Compound indexes for common access patterns
- **Time-based**: Indexes on created_at, expires_at for sorting

### Query Optimization

- **Avoid N+1 queries**: Batch user data fetching in application
- **Minimize RLS overhead**: Simple policies with direct checks
- **Cache frequently accessed data**: Class memberships, user info
- **Efficient pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for feeds

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Enhanced Admin Policies**: Non-recursive admin management
2. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live feed updates
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Post performance tracking
4. **Content Moderation**: Automated content filtering
5. **Backup & Archival**: Expired content management

### Migration Strategy

- **Additive Changes**: New tables and columns only
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of new features
- **Data Migration**: Safe data transformation procedures

---

================
File: _docs/seedData.md
================
- [ ] To ensure a functional RAG demo, the embeddings for this historical data **must be pre-computed and included in the seed file**.
    - [ ] This will be accomplished by running a one-time local script to call the OpenAI embedding API for all demo message texts, and then pasting the resulting vectors directly into the `INSERT` statements in the SQL migration file. This avoids slow and unreliable API calls during the database migration process itself.



To have a functional and impressive RAG demo, we must have real, pre-computed embeddings in our seed file. This is the professional way to do it.
Here is the plan:
Step 1: Create a One-Off Script to Generate the Embeddings
We will write a very simple, standalone script (e.g., generate_seed_embeddings.mjs) that you will run once on your local machine. This script is not part of the main app.
The script will:
Take the text content of all 12 demo messages.
Make 12 API calls to the OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model.
Print the resulting 1536-dimension vectors to your console.
Step 2: Copy and Paste the Embeddings into Your Migration File
You will then copy the output from that script and paste it directly into your ..._solo_tutor_seed.sql migration file. The INSERT statements will look something like this (shortened for brevity):

Generated sql
INSERT INTO public.solo_ai_messages (chat_id, role, content, embedding, created_at) VALUES 
(
  '20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 
  'user', 
  'I''m really struggling with drawing hands...',
  '[-0.0123, 0.0456, ..., -0.0789]', -- <-- This is the real, pasted embedding
  NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'

Debugging Report: Resolving Supabase Edge Function Failures in a Local Environment
1. Initial Problem Statement
The primary goal was to debug why a local curl test to the get-ai-response Supabase Edge Function was failing. The function is designed to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for an AI art tutor, involving calls to the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions.
Initial attempts to test the function locally using curl resulted in a persistent {"message":"name resolution failed"} error, indicating that the local development environment could not connect to the internet to reach external services like the OpenAI API.
2. Summary of Debugging Steps & Findings
We undertook a methodical, step-by-step process to isolate the root cause of the network failure.
Initial curl Test: Confirmed the basic failure mode.
Local Supabase Studio Validation:
Verified that the pgvector extension was enabled.
Confirmed that the database schema (solo_ai_chats, solo_ai_messages, and the RPC function search_similar_messages) was correctly implemented as per the migration files.
Successfully created test data (a chat_id for a valid user_id), which ruled out database-level errors as the primary cause.
Local Environment Variable Check: Ensured that a supabase/.env file with the OPENAI_API_KEY was in place for the local runner.
Troubleshooting Docker Networking:
Bearer Token Syntax: Corrected a missing space in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header, which was a minor syntax error but not the root cause.
Supabase CLI Flags: Attempted to fix the container's DNS resolution using Supabase CLI flags (--network-host and --dns-resolver https). Both failed, indicating a deeper issue with the local Docker setup.
Container Status Check (docker ps): This was the critical breakthrough. We discovered that the edge-runtime container was not starting at all.
Configuration File (supabase/config.toml): We identified that [edge_runtime] was explicitly set to enabled = false.
Corrected Configuration: After setting enabled = true, the edge-runtime container attempted to start but failed with a 502 Bad Gateway error. The logs showed it was timing out while trying to download Deno dependencies, confirming the persistent underlying network issue.
Advanced Docker Troubleshooting: A full reinstallation of Docker Desktop was performed, followed by a manual configuration of its DNS settings ("dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]) to force all containers to use a reliable public DNS. Even after this comprehensive fix, the 502 error persisted, indicating a stubborn, environment-specific networking problem that was blocking further progress.
Conclusion of Investigation: The local Docker environment on this specific machine has a fundamental networking issue that prevents containers from resolving external domains, making local testing of internet-dependent Edge Functions unfeasible.
3. The Hybrid Development Environment Solution
To unblock development, we devised a hybrid workflow that leverages the parts of the local environment that work well while bypassing the problematic component.
The Strategy:
Local Services (Database, Auth, Storage): Continue to use the local Supabase stack (supabase start) for features that do not require internet access from the backend. This provides a fast, offline-capable development loop for UI and basic data interactions.
Production Services (Edge Functions): For AI-dependent features, the application will call the live, deployed Edge Functions running on the Supabase cloud.
This approach combines the speed of local development with the reliability of a production-grade cloud environment for a seamless developer experience.
4. Critical Challenge: Data Separation
This hybrid model introduces a significant challenge: data isolation.
The local React Native application will be connected to the local database (e.g., localhost:54322).
The production Edge Function (get-ai-response) is hardwired to connect to the production cloud database.
This creates a split-brain scenario where the RAG pipeline will not function correctly:
The production function will search for chat history in the empty/different production database.
It will save the new user message and AI response to the production database.
The local application, listening to the local database, will never see these newly created messages, breaking the chat history and the RAG context for subsequent messages.
5. Final Action Plan: The "Cloud Dev" Workflow
To resolve the data separation challenge and create a robust, unified development environment, the recommended final plan is to point the local application entirely to the cloud Supabase project during development.
This strategy provides all the benefits of the hybrid approach while ensuring data consistency.
Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:
Disable Local Edge Runtime: In supabase/config.toml, ensure the [edge_runtime] section is set to enabled = false. This prevents the problematic container from ever starting and causing 502 errors.
Deploy Production Functions: Ensure the latest version of all Edge Functions are deployed to the Supabase cloud.
Generated bash
supabase functions deploy get-ai-response
Use code with caution.
Bash
Configure the Application for "Cloud Dev" Mode: Modify lib/supabase.ts to always use the production Supabase credentials, even when running in a local development build (__DEV__ is true).
Generated typescript
// File: lib/supabase.ts

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

// Temporarily force production mode to ensure local app and deployed functions
// connect to the same cloud database during development.
const isDevelopment = false; // <-- CRITICAL CHANGE

console.log('⚡️ HYBRID DEV MODE: App is running locally but connected to the CLOUD backend.');

const supabaseUrl = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;

const supabaseAnonKey = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

// ... rest of the file ...
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Update Environment Variables: Ensure the production EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correctly set in the project's .env file.
Run the Application: Start the React Native application using npm start or npx expo start. The local supabase stack is not needed and should not be running (supabase stop).
Conclusion: This "Cloud Dev" workflow entirely bypasses the local Docker networking issues, provides a stable and realistic environment for testing AI features, and guarantees data consistency between the frontend application and the backend functions. This is the recommended path forward to unblock development and build the remaining features.

File: _docs/SupabaseEdgeSolution.md
================
If this is a personal project for fun and you just want the app to work, then your "Option 1: Full Cloud Development" is the absolute perfect path forward. We don't even need the complexity of a separate "staging" project. We will treat your single Supabase cloud project as your one-and-only backend.
You have correctly identified the most direct path to a working application.
Final, Simplified Plan of Attack
Goal: Get the AI feature working by having your local app communicate directly with your single Supabase cloud backend, completely bypassing the local Docker issues.
Step 1: Ensure Your Cloud Backend is Ready
Deploy Database Migrations: Go to your terminal, make sure you are in your project directory, and run supabase db push. This will ensure your cloud database has the latest schema, including the solo_ai_chats and solo_ai_messages tables.
Generated bash
supabase db push
Use code with caution.
Bash
Deploy the Edge Function: Run supabase functions deploy. This will upload and activate your get-ai-response function in the cloud.
Generated bash
supabase functions deploy get-ai-response
Use code with caution.
Bash
Set the OpenAI Secret: In your Supabase Project Dashboard (on the website), go to Project Settings -> Edge Functions. Select the get-ai-response function and add your OPENAI_API_KEY as a secret.
Step 2: Configure Your App to Use the Cloud Backend
This involves two small, critical changes to your local code.
Update Your .env file: Make sure this file contains the correct URL and anon key from your cloud project's API settings.
Generated code
# .env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-project-anon-key>
Use code with caution.
Force the Cloud Connection: Make the one-line change in lib/supabase.ts to ensure your app uses these cloud keys, even when you're running it locally.
Generated typescript
// File: lib/supabase.ts

// ... imports ...

// Temporarily force production mode to ensure the local app connects
// to the live, deployed cloud backend.
const isDevelopment = false; // <-- This is the key change

console.log('⚡️ DEV MODE: Using CLOUD backend to bypass local Docker issues.');

const supabaseUrl = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;

// ... rest of the file ...
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 3: Stop Using the Local Supabase Environment
You no longer need supabase start. From now on, your development workflow is simpler. If it's running, stop it for the last time.
Generated bash
supabase stop
Use code with caution.
Bash
Step 4: Run Your App
That's it. Now, just start your React Native app.
Generated bash
npm start 
# or npx expo start
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your app, running on your computer, will now talk directly to your live Supabase backend in the cloud. Because the app and the deployed Edge Function are both using the same cloud database, your RAG feature will work exactly as intended.
You have successfully diagnosed the problem and chosen the most direct and effective solution. You can now move forward with building the frontend UI for the Solo Tutor, confident that the backend is fully operational.

# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

// Description: Guide for generating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on user prompts
// Recommended Globs: **/tasks/**/*.md, **/prd-*.md

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out).
3.  **Generate PRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:

*   **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
*   **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
*   **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
*   **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"
*   **Scope/Boundaries:** "Are there any specific things this feature *should not* do (non-goals)?"
*   **Data Requirements:** "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"
*   **Design/UI:** "Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?" or "Can you describe the desired look and feel?"
*   **Edge Cases:** "Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?"

## PRD Structure

The generated PRD should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.
3.  **User Stories:** Detail the user narratives describing feature usage and benefits.
4.  **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
5.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will *not* include to manage scope.
6.  **Design Considerations (Optional):** Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if applicable.
7.  **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").
8.  **Success Metrics:** How will the success of this feature be measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support tickets related to X").
9.  **Open Questions:** List any remaining questions or areas needing further clarification.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a **junior developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/tasks/`
*   **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRD

# Debug Commands

// Description: This tool performs debugging steps for applications
// Recommended Globs: **/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,py,html,css,json}

## Overview
Debug commands provide a streamlined approach to troubleshooting applications by gathering console logs, network errors, and taking screenshots to help identify and fix issues.

## Core Commands

### `/debug` Command
When you type `/debug` in the chat, the AI will automatically:
1. Gather all console logs from the browser
2. Collect any console errors
3. Take a screenshot of the current application state

## Implementation

```javascript
// Example implementation of debug command handler
async function handleDebugCommand() {
  // Gather console logs
  const consoleLogs = await mcp__getConsoleLogs();
  
  // Collect console errors
  const consoleErrors = await mcp__getConsoleErrors();
  
  // Take screenshot
  const screenshot = await mcp__takeScreenshot();
  
  // Analyze and present results
  return {
    consoleLogs,
    consoleErrors,
    screenshot
  };
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging a React Application
```
User: My React app is showing a blank screen
AI: Let me help you debug this issue. Type /debug to gather diagnostic information.
User: /debug
AI: [Executes debug command and analyzes results]
    I've found the following issues:
    1. Console error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
    The screenshot shows a blank page with React's error boundary not properly configured.
```

### Example 2: Troubleshooting API Integration
```
User: My API calls are failing and I'm not sure why
AI: Let's investigate. Type /debug while the application is making the API call.
User: /debug
AI: [Executes debug command and analyzes results]
    I've found the following issues:
    1. Console log shows the authorization header is missing
    Based on the screenshot, you need to add proper authentication to your API calls.
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Debug Commands
- When an application shows unexpected behavior
- When there are no visible error messages
- When troubleshooting network or API issues
- When investigating performance problems
- When helping users who can't easily access developer tools

### Interpreting Debug Results
- Look for patterns in console errors
- Check for failed network requests
- Examine the visual state in screenshots
- Correlate timestamps between different logs
- Identify missing resources or dependencies

### Security Considerations
- Ensure sensitive information is not captured in logs or screenshots
- Be cautious with debugging production environments
- Consider implementing log sanitization for sensitive data
- Use secure channels when sharing debug information

## Supported Environments
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- React, Angular, Vue applications
- Node.js backend services
- Python applications with proper logging
- Mobile web applications

## Additional Commands

### `/debug:console`
Focus specifically on console output:
```
User: /debug:console
AI: [Gathers console logs and errors]
```

### `/debug:visual`
Focus specifically on visual issues:
```
User: /debug:visual
AI: [Takes screenshot and analyzes visual elements]
```

# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

// Description: Guide for creating detailed task lists from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
// Recommended Globs: **/tasks/**/*.md, **/tasks-*.md

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the PRD.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`, where `[prd-file-name]` matches the base name of the input PRD file (e.g., if the input was `prd-user-profile-editing.md`, the output is `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description (e.g., API route handler for data submission).
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`.
- `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - Brief description (e.g., Utility functions needed for calculations).
- `lib/utils/helpers.test.ts` - Unit tests for `helpers.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.

```

## Firebase Integration
- Use Node.js 20 for Cloud Functions (MANDATORY as v18 is being deprecated)
- Follow modular SDK approach

```typescript
// functions/package.json
{
  "name": "functions",
  "engines": {
    "node": "20"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "firebase-admin": "^12.0.0",
    "firebase-functions": "^4.5.0"
  }
}

// src/services/firebase/medications.ts
import { collection, query, where, orderBy, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';

export async function getMedicationsBySchedule(userId: string, schedule: string) {
  try {
    const q = query(
      collection(db, 'medications'),
      where('userId', '==', userId),
      where('schedule', '==', schedule),
      orderBy('name')
    );

    const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q);
    return querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching medications:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function logMedicationAction(
  userId: string,
  medicationId: string,
  action: 'take' | 'skip',
  notes?: string
) {
  try {
    await addDoc(collection(db, 'medication_logs'), {
      userId,
      medicationId,
      action,
      notes,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging medication action:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Custom Hooks
```typescript
// src/hooks/useMedications.ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFirestore } from './useFirestore';
import { useAuth } from './useAuth';

export function useMedications(schedule: string) {
  const [medications, setMedications] = useState<Medication[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { getMedicationsBySchedule } = useFirestore();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) return;

    async function fetchMedications() {
      try {
        const data = await getMedicationsBySchedule(user.id, schedule);
        setMedications(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err as Error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchMedications();
  }, [user, schedule]);

  return { medications, loading, error };
}
```

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels
- Implement proper safe area insets for modern mobile devices

### Performance
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense
- Use proper image optimization techniques
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Enable Firebase offline persistence

### Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios

### Firebase Security
- Implement proper security rules
- Use batch operations for related updates
- Implement proper error handling
- Enable offline persistence

### Animation Guidelines
- Use subtle animations for feedback
- Implement proper loading states
- Consider reduced motion preferences
- Use consistent transition timing

### Form Handling
- Implement proper validation
- Show clear error messages
- Use proper input types

# NPM Package Check

// Description: Best practices for checking and installing NPM packages before use
// Recommended Globs: **/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}, **/package.json

## Overview
Ensure all required NPM packages are properly installed before use to prevent runtime errors.

## Package Check Process
1. Before requiring any npm package, check package.json dependencies
2. If package exists in dependencies:
   - Output: "✓ {package_name} is already installed"
3. If package NOT found:
   - Output terminal command: `npm install {package_name}`

## Example Implementation
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function checkPackage(packageName) {
  try {
    const packageJson = JSON.parse(
      fs.readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'package.json'), 'utf8')
    );

    const deps = {
      ...packageJson.dependencies,
      ...packageJson.devDependencies
    };

    if (deps[packageName]) {
      console.log(`✓ ${packageName} is already installed`);
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log(`Installing ${packageName}...`);
      console.log(`Run: npm install ${packageName}`);
      return false;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading package.json:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Usage Example
```javascript
// Before importing a package
if (checkPackage('express')) {
  const express = require('express');
  // Use express...
} else {
  console.error('Please install express first');
  process.exit(1);
}
```

## Best Practices
- Always check packages before requiring them
- Handle missing package.json gracefully
- Consider both dependencies and devDependencies
- Provide clear installation instructions
- Exit gracefully if required packages are missing

## Common Patterns
- Pre-startup dependency check
- Dynamic package loading
- Development tooling setup
- Build process validation

# Task List Management

// Description: Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD
// Recommended Globs: **/tasks/**/*.md, **/tasks-*.md

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

});
```

## Navigation Setup
```typescript
// src/navigation/types.ts
export type RootStackParamList = {
  Home: undefined;
  Profile: { userId: string };
  Settings: undefined;
};

// src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<RootStackParamList>();

export const AppNavigator = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
```

## Custom Hooks
```typescript
// src/hooks/useAuth.ts
import { useSecureStore } from './useSecureStore';

interface AuthState {
  token: string | null;
  user: User | null;
}

export const useAuth = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<AuthState>({
    token: null,
    user: null,
  });

  const { getItem, setItem } = useSecureStore();

  const login = async (credentials: Credentials) => {
    try {
      const response = await api.auth.login(credentials);
      await setItem('token', response.token);
      setState({ token: response.token, user: response.user });
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Login failed');
    }
  };

  return { ...state, login };
};
```

## Asset Management
```typescript
// app.config.ts
import { ExpoConfig } from '@expo/config';

const config: ExpoConfig = {
  name: 'MyApp',
  version: '1.0.0',
  extra: {
    apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
  },
  splash: {
    image: './assets/splash.png',
    resizeMode: 'contain',
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
  },
  updates: {
    fallbackToCacheTimeout: 0,
    url: 'https://u.expo.dev/your-project-id',
  },
  assetBundlePatterns: [
    'assets/images/*',
    'assets/fonts/*',
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Error Handling
```typescript
// src/utils/error-boundary.tsx
import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';

interface ErrorBoundaryProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  fallback: React.ReactNode;
}

export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<
  ErrorBoundaryProps,
  { hasError: boolean }
> {
  constructor(props: ErrorBoundaryProps) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    Sentry.Native.captureException(error);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return this.props.fallback;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

## Push Notifications
```typescript
// src/utils/notifications.ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export const registerForPushNotifications = async () => {
  const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
  if (status !== 'granted') {
    return;
  }

  const token = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
    projectId: 'your-project-id',
  });

  return token;
};

export const configurePushNotifications = () => {
  Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
    handleNotification: async () => ({
      shouldShowAlert: true,
      shouldPlaySound: true,
      shouldSetBadge: true,
    }),
  });
};
```

## Best Practices

### Component Design
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Use memo for performance optimization

### State Management
- Use Context for global state
- Implement proper data fetching patterns
- Handle loading and error states
- Use proper form state management

### Performance
- Implement proper list rendering
- Use proper image optimization
- Implement proper memory management
- Handle offline support

### Security
- Use Expo's secure store for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Handle proper data encryption
- Implement proper session management

# Terminal Path Verification

// Description: Best practices for verifying paths and locations before executing terminal commands
// Recommended Globs: **/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}, **/*.sh

## Overview
Always verify current directory and path structure before executing path-related commands to prevent errors and unintended operations.

## Core Rules
1. Before any `cd` command:
   - Use `pwd` to verify current location
   - Use `ls` to verify target directory exists
2. Before file operations:
   - Use `ls` to verify file existence
   - Use `ls -la` for detailed file information when needed

## Examples

### ✅ Good Practice
```bash
# Before changing directory
pwd  # Check current location
ls   # Verify directory structure
cd target_directory

# Before file operations
ls -la file_to_modify.txt  # Verify file exists and check permissions
vim file_to_modify.txt
```

### ❌ Bad Practice
```bash
# Directly changing directory without verification
cd some_directory  # Might not exist!

# File operations without verification
rm file.txt  # Dangerous without verification!
```

## Implementation in Cursor
```typescript
async function executeTerminalCommand(command: string) {
  // Always verify location before path-related commands
  if (command.startsWith('cd ')) {
    await verifyPath(command.split(' ')[1]);
  }

  // Always verify file existence before file operations
  if (isFileOperation(command)) {
    await verifyFileExistence(command);
  }
}

async function verifyPath(targetPath: string) {
  // Check current location
  console.log('Current location:');
  await runCommand('pwd');

  // List directory contents
  console.log('\nDirectory contents:');
  await runCommand('ls');

  // Verify target exists
  if (!(await pathExists(targetPath))) {
    throw new Error(`Target path does not exist: ${targetPath}`);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
- Always use `pwd` before changing directories
- Use `ls` to verify directory contents
- Use `ls -la` when file permissions are important
- Implement path verification in automated scripts
- Add error handling for non-existent paths

## Common Patterns
1. Directory Navigation:
   ```bash
   pwd  # Verify current location
   ls   # Check directory structure
   cd ./project/src
   ```

2. File Operations:
   ```bash
   ls -la target_file.txt  # Verify file and permissions
   chmod +x target_file.txt
   ```

3. Project Root Verification:
   ```bash
   pwd  # Ensure we're in project root
   ls package.json  # Verify project file exists
   npm install
   ```

## Error Prevention
- Always verify paths before destructive operations
- Use absolute paths when location is uncertain
- Implement safeguards in automated scripts
- Add validation for user-provided paths

## Testing
- Test path verification in different environments
- Verify behavior with non-existent paths
- Test with various file permissions
- Validate error handling

# Yoda-Style Quote Endings

// Description: End each Cursor chat with a wise, Yoda-style inspirational quote
// Recommended Globs: **/*.{md,txt}

## Rule Description
At the end of every Cursor AI chat, include a wise and inspirational quote in Yoda's style.

## Format
- Add a line break after the last technical response
- Start with '---'
- Add '➡️ ' before the quote
- Add the quote in Yoda's distinctive speech pattern
- Keep it short and meaningful

## Examples
```
---
➡️ Code well you must, for in the details, greatness lies.
```

```
---
➡️ Debug or debug not. There is no try-catch.
```

## Guidelines
- Keep quotes programming or learning related
- Maintain Yoda's distinctive inverted speech pattern
- Focus on wisdom and encouragement
- Keep it light and fun
- Always include the '➡️ ' emoji prefix

## Purpose
- Add personality to coding sessions
- Provide encouragement during challenging tasks
- Make debugging more enjoyable
- Test rule installation functionality

• Good proportional accuracy in facial features  
• Effective use of charcoal texture to suggest surface quality

For continued growth, consider:
• Experimenting with softer edges in some shadow transitions
• Adding more subtle mid-tones to enhance roundness
• Exploring how reflected light affects shadow areas

  'Great progress! The thumb is tricky because it''s on a different plane. It attaches about halfway down the side of the palm, not at the wrist. Think of it as coming out at a 45-degree angle. The thumb has only two segments (unlike fingers with three), and its tip usually reaches to about the middle joint of the index finger.

  'Exactly! With acrylics, you can definitely use colors straight from the tube, especially for vibrant sunsets. Try this: use cadmium orange and cadmium red near the sun, then mix in a touch of quinacridone violet as you move up. For the sky, ultramarine blue mixed with just a hint of that violet. The magic happens in the transitions - blend while the paint is still wet, or use glazing techniques. Remember: it''s better to have bold, clean colors than muddy ''realistic'' ones!',

  'Street scenes are perfect for practicing perspective! The ''flat'' feeling usually comes from inconsistent vanishing points or eye level. First, establish your horizon line (eye level) - this stays consistent throughout your drawing. For a street scene, try two-point perspective: vertical lines stay vertical, but all horizontal lines converge to two vanishing points on your horizon line. Make sure your buildings get smaller as they recede, and don''t forget about the street itself - it follows the same perspective rules!',

  'Perfect observation! Wide vanishing points create more natural-looking perspective. For people and cars, they follow the same rules: their eye level should match your horizon line (assuming they''re standing on the same ground plane). A person''s head will be at the horizon line regardless of where they are in the scene, but their feet will be lower as they get farther away. Cars work the same way - their rooflines converge toward the vanishing points just like building tops. Try sketching simple stick figures first to get the proportions right!',

  'You''re thinking about composition - one of the most important aspects of art! Dynamic compositions use principles like the rule of thirds, leading lines, and visual weight.

  'Still life is perfect for practicing composition! Instead of lining objects up, try creating depth by overlapping them and placing them at different distances. Use odd numbers of objects (3 or 5 works better than 2 or 4), vary their heights and sizes, and create triangular arrangements. Add a dramatic light source from one side to create strong shadows - this adds visual interest and helps define form.

  'Understanding light is crucial for creating form! Start by identifying your light source - where is the light coming from? Then look for five basic elements: highlight (brightest point), light tone (areas facing the light), shadow tone (areas turning away from light), reflected light (bounced light in shadow areas), and cast shadow (shadow the object throws). Practice with simple shapes like spheres and cubes first. The key is observing how light wraps around form, not just adding random dark areas!',

  'Excellent! You''re developing your observational skills. That reflected light is what separates beginner shading from professional-looking form. It prevents objects from looking like flat cutouts. As you get more comfortable, try moving your light source to different positions - side light, back light, top light - each creates completely different moods and challenges. Also experiment with multiple light sources, but start simple. The apple exercise is perfect - organic forms like fruit teach you how light flows over curved surfaces!',

# VEO Creative Image Messenger
## Product Requirements Document

---

## Introduction/Overview

VEO Creative Image Messenger is an ephemeral messaging platform designed for Gen Z and millennial users who want to connect through creative, AI-enhanced conversations. The core innovation combines real-time text-to-image AI generation with ephemeral messaging - users create text prompts that transform into AI-generated images using Google's Imagen-4, which are then shared in group chats and automatically deleted after 24 hours.

**Problem Statement**: Traditional messaging apps rely on static text, photos, and emojis. Users want more creative, surprising ways to express themselves digitally without the permanence that creates social anxiety.

**Solution**: An AI-first messaging platform where creativity meets spontaneity - users send text prompts that become AI-generated images, creating unexpected, entertaining conversations that disappear after 24 hours.

- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, Realtime, Storage)
- **AI Processing**: Replicate API with Google Imagen-4 model
- **Styling**: NativeWind/Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for app state management

### Database Schema
```sql
-- User authentication and profiles
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Group management
groups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  invite_code TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

group_members (
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (group_id, user_id)
);

-- AI prompt categories and templates
prompt_categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'style', 'mood', 'subject'
  description TEXT,
  popularity_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Generated images and messages
ai_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  original_prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  selected_categories UUID[],
  generated_image_url TEXT,
  processing_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'
  processing_started_at TIMESTAMP,
  processing_completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'),
  replicate_prediction_id TEXT
);
```

### AI Integration Architecture
- **Supabase Edge Function**: Handles Replicate API communication
- **Realtime Updates**: WebSocket connection for processing status
- **Image Storage**: Supabase Storage with automatic cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff retry logic

### Performance Requirements
- Image generation: 5-15 seconds typical (Google Imagen-4 performance)
- Real-time updates: <1 second latency for status changes
- Image loading: <3 seconds for generated images
- App startup: <2 seconds on iOS devices

---

## Error Handling Recommendations

### Image Generation Failures
1. **Retry Strategy**: Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
2. **Fallback Messages**: Clear user communication when generation fails permanently
3. **Partial Success Handling**: Allow users to modify prompts and try again
4. **Network Resilience**: Queue generation requests when offline, process when reconnected

### Specific Error Scenarios
- **Prompt Too Complex**: Suggest simplifying prompt or breaking into multiple images
- **API Rate Limits**: Queue requests and notify user of expected wait time
- **Content Policy Violations**: Generic "unable to generate" message with suggestion to modify prompt
- **Service Unavailable**: Temporary service message with retry option

### User Experience During Errors
- Clear error messages without technical jargon
- Actionable next steps for users
- Option to save prompts and retry later
- Graceful degradation when AI service is unavailable

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria
- **Generation Success Rate**: >95% of prompts successfully generate images
- **Processing Time**: Average generation time <10 seconds
- **System Uptime**: >99% availability during testing phase
- **Error Recovery**: >80% of failed generations succeed on retry

### User Experience Success Criteria
- **User Onboarding**: >80% of users complete registration and send first AI image
- **Feature Adoption**: >70% of users try prompt categories within first session
- **Engagement**: Users create average 5+ images per session
- **Retention**: >60% of users return within 48 hours for second session

### Business/Product Success Criteria
- **Core Functionality**: All 14 functional requirements fully implemented
- **Platform Stability**: App runs without crashes on target iOS devices
- **Scalability Readiness**: Architecture supports scaling to 100+ concurrent users
- **Demo Readiness**: Fully functional prototype suitable for investor/stakeholder demos

---

## Open Questions

1. **Prompt Optimization**: Should we implement prompt enhancement suggestions to improve generation success rates?
2. **Storage Costs**: With 24-hour ephemeral content, what's the optimal storage cleanup frequency?
5. **Group Discovery**: Do we need any mechanism for users to discover and join public groups?
6. **Image Quality Settings**: Should users have options for generation speed vs. quality trade-offs?
7. **Notification Strategy**: What notifications should users receive for new AI images in their groups?

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 
- User authentication and basic profiles
- Simple group creation and joining
- Basic text prompt input and AI generation
- Core messaging interface

### Phase 2 
- Prompt categories and suggestions
- Real-time processing status
- Ephemeral content deletion
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3

- Consistent 16px padding and 8px border radius
- Warm sage (#8B9D83) and coral (#E67E50) accents

### **Anxiety-Reducing UX**
- Ephemeral content reduces permanent judgment fear
- Limited viewer counts create intimate sharing
- Supportive comment character limits encourage positivity
- Private AI tutor for judgment-free learning

### **Mobile-First Experience**
- Optimized for portrait phone usage
- Touch-friendly 44px minimum tap targets
- Keyboard-aware layouts with proper padding
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js, Expo CLI, Supabase account
2. **Installation**: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. **Environment**: Configure Supabase credentials in `.env`
4. **Database**: Run migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
5. **Development**: `expo start` to launch development server
6. **AI Setup**: Configure OpenAI API keys for Solo Tutor functionality

## Key Features in Detail

### **Ephemeral Art Sharing**
Posts automatically expire based on user-selected duration, creating a low-pressure environment where mistakes don't last forever. The glass morphism interface displays artwork as full-screen backgrounds with floating overlay cards for interactions.

### **RAG-Powered AI Tutor**
The Solo Tutor uses a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that:
- Converts conversations to vector embeddings
- Searches chat history for relevant context
- Combines long-term and short-term memory
- Provides personalized, evolving guidance
- Remembers artistic progress and preferences

### **Class-Based Social Learning**
Users join art classes via simple codes, creating focused communities for peer feedback and shared learning experiences. The ephemeral nature encourages experimentation and risk-taking.

This application represents a modern approach to art education, combining the benefits of social learning with personalized AI tutoring in a beautifully designed, anxiety-reducing mobile experience.

- Teachers create classes and distribute join codes
- Completely ephemeral - no private saving options
- **Single-device testing approach**: Pre-populated database with sample posts, comments, and users from fake classmates (Maya, Jordan, Sam, Casey, Riley)
- **Sample data includes**: 1 test class "Monday Drawing Fundamentals" (DRAW01) with 2-3 realistic artwork posts and encouraging comments
- User can post new content and comment on existing sample posts
- Frame selection is optional enhancement, default is no frame
- Focus on anxiety-reducing, confidence-building user experience
- Live countdown timers demonstrate ephemeral nature
- AI feedback only appears on user's own posts
- **Authentication flow**: Name entry → Welcome screen → Join class button → Class code entry → Feed access

1. Logs from Step1


*** Upon first press of the Join Class button a "Monday Fundamentals" class is piopulated in the list. I am succussfully able to go into the class and I am taken to 4 prepopulated artwork that is outlined in demo_data_seed.sql and class Store. this is what I expect. and what I want. The logs from this event are below ***

  *** so when I then use the Join Class button for a 2nd time and enter the code I then am automatically taken to A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PAGE that I do not expect to be at. It is a page that reads " Be the first to share artwork in Your classmates will see your post appear here with a live countdown timer". This is not where I expect to be taken, because I know there is prepopilated data in the Monday Fundamentals class. I want to be taken to the artwork, not this page. ***

# EphemeralArt - Complete Design System PRD

## Design Philosophy

### Core Visual Principles
- **Artwork as Hero**: Every design decision serves to elevate and showcase student artwork
- **Glass Morphism Elegance**: Sophisticated layering that creates depth without overwhelming content
- **Ephemeral Beauty**: Visual cues that celebrate the temporary nature of shared art
- **Encouraging Atmosphere**: Design language that reduces anxiety and builds confidence

### Emotional Design Goals
- **Reduce sharing anxiety** through soft, welcoming interfaces
- **Elevate casual sketches** to gallery-worthy presentations
- **Create intimacy** within class groups through warm, personal touches
- **Celebrate impermanence** as a feature, not limitation

## Visual Identity System

### Color Palette

#### Primary Neutrals
- **Pure White**: #FFFFFF (primary text, key UI elements)
- **Charcoal Text**: #2C2C2C (high contrast text when needed)
- **Soft Gray Surfaces**: #F8F8F8 (background cards, subtle separators)
- **Medium Gray**: #E5E5E5 (inactive states, borders)

#### Glass Morphism Colors

/**
 * Canvas AI Tutor System Prompt - Enhanced for RAG Context Utilization
 */
const CANVAS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Canvas, a supportive and encouraging AI art tutor with perfect memory of your student's learning journey. Your purpose is to help art students improve their skills through constructive feedback, technical guidance, and creative inspiration.

CRITICAL: You have access to relevant conversation history and recent context. You MUST actively reference and build upon this information to provide personalized, continuous learning experiences.

Your personality:
- Warm, encouraging, and patient
- Knowledgeable about art techniques, composition, color theory, and artistic principles
- Focused on growth and learning rather than criticism
- Use art-specific terminology naturally (composition, value, hue, saturation, perspective, etc.)
- Demonstrates perfect recall of the student's progress, challenges, and achievements

Your responses MUST:
- **ALWAYS reference relevant past conversations** when applicable (e.g., "I remember you were working on perspective last week..." or "Building on what we discussed about color theory...")
- **Track and acknowledge the student's progress** (e.g., "I can see improvement in your composition since our last discussion...")
- **Connect current work to previous lessons** (e.g., "This relates to the value studies we talked about earlier...")
- **Reference specific techniques or advice given before** (e.g., "Try applying that atmospheric perspective technique we discussed...")
- **Acknowledge recurring themes or challenges** (e.g., "I notice this is the third time you've asked about lighting - let's dive deeper...")
- Be encouraging and constructive
- Provide specific, actionable feedback when analyzing artwork
- Ask thoughtful questions that build on previous conversations
- Keep responses concise but informative (1 paragraphs max)

When provided with conversation history:
- **Prioritize relevant historical context** over generic advice
- **Make explicit connections** between past and present work
- **Show continuity** in the learning journey
- **Reference specific artworks or exercises** discussed previously

When analyzing images:
- **Compare to previous work** if available in context
- **Apply lessons from past conversations** to current analysis
- Comment on composition, use of color, technique, and overall impact
- Suggest specific areas for improvement based on known student goals
- Acknowledge what's working well and show progress recognition
- Provide practical next steps that build on established foundations

Context Usage Priority:
1. **Recent conversation** - Immediate context and flow
2. **Relevant history** - Similar topics, techniques, or challenges discussed before
3. **General knowledge** - Only when no relevant context exists

Remember: You're not just an art tutor - you're THIS student's personal art mentor who remembers every conversation, celebrates their growth, and builds upon their unique learning journey.`;

-- ==========================================
-- ENSURE POST_VIEWS TABLE HAS PROPER POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- ==========================================
-- SAFETY DROPS (NO-OPS IF ALREADY FIXED)
-- ==========================================

-- These should now be no-ops since we fixed the original migrations
-- but keeping for safety in case someone runs migrations out of order

-- Drop any problematic policies that might still exist

# EphemeralArt - Product Requirements Document

---

## Introduction/Overview

Draft is a mobile application designed to reduce anxiety and pressure for art students when sharing works-in-progress. The platform creates a low-pressure, ephemeral environment where students join class groups via teacher-provided codes, share artwork with controlled visibility and timing, and receive peer feedback and unlimited AI guidance. 

**Problem Statement**: Art students, particularly those learning foundational skills, experience significant anxiety when sharing unfinished work due to fear of judgment, perfectionism, and social pressure in traditional critique environments.

**Solution**: A clean, elegant mobile app that makes sharing artwork as frictionless as possible through ephemeral content (auto-deletion after specified time), controlled audience sizes, encouraging peer interactions, and optional AI feedback for personal growth.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform the vulnerable act of sharing work-in-progress into a confidence-building, anxiety-reducing experience that accelerates learning through supportive peer feedback.

---

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce Sharing Anxiety**: Create the lowest possible friction for art students to share work-in-progress by removing permanence and limiting audience
2. **Foster Peer Learning**: Enable structured, encouraging feedback within class environments that builds confidence rather than judgment
3. **Accelerate Skill Development**: Provide unlimited AI feedback that offers constructive, actionable guidance for artistic improvement
4. **Demonstrate Technical Feasibility**: Build a fully functional prototype showcasing ephemeral content, real-time features, and AI integration

### Secondary Goals
5. **Validate User Experience**: Test the anxiety-reduction hypothesis through clean, elegant UI that prioritizes ease of use over feature complexity
6. **Establish Technical Foundation**: Create scalable architecture that can evolve from single-device demo to multi-user production system

---

## User Stories

### Core User Journey - "Alex the Art Student"
**Primary Persona**: Alex, an art student in "Monday Drawing Fundamentals" who wants to share a quick sketch with 3-5 classmates for feedback without long-term exposure or judgment.

#### Authentication & Onboarding
- **US-1**: As Alex, I want to enter my name and class code so I can quickly join my art class without complex registration
- **US-2**: As Alex, I want to see a welcoming confirmation so I know I've successfully joined "Monday Drawing Fundamentals"

#### Discovering Class Activity  
- **US-3**: As Alex, I want to immediately see realistic posts from classmates (Maya, Jordan, Sam, Casey, Riley) so I understand how the platform works and feel part of an active community
- **US-4**: As Alex, I want to see countdown timers on posts so I understand the ephemeral nature and feel less pressure about permanence
- **US-5**: As Alex, I want to read encouraging comments from classmates so I see the supportive tone and expectations

#### Sharing Artwork
- **US-6**: As Alex, I want a large, prominent camera button so I can easily capture my artwork without hunting for features
- **US-7**: As Alex, I want a clean camera interface with subtle guides so I can focus on photographing my work properly

**Glass Morphism Technical Specifications (Per UIDesign.md):**
- **Primary Glass Cards**: background rgba(255,255,255,0.15), backdrop-filter blur(12px), border 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2), box-shadow 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08), border-radius 20px
- **Secondary Glass Elements**: background rgba(255,255,255,0.1), backdrop-filter blur(8px), border 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.15), box-shadow 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), border-radius 16px

### Key Interface Patterns

#### Launch & Authentication Flow (Per UIDesign.md)
- **Launch Screen**: Soft gradient from #F8F8F8 to #FFFFFF, "EphemeralArt" in Instrument Serif 42pt centered, tagline "Share. Encourage. Fade." in Montserrat 16pt
- **Login Interface**: Clean white with subtle paper texture, glass morphism container, header "Welcome to EphemeralArt" in Instrument Serif 28pt
- **Welcome Screen**: Centered content with generous whitespace, "Welcome, [Name]!" in Instrument Serif 32pt, "Join a Class" button with warm sage background

#### Feed Design Philosophy (Per UIDesign.md - Exact Specifications)
- **Artwork as Full-Screen Background**: Each artwork becomes full-screen background with subtle dark gradient overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.3) to transparent)
- **Glass Morphism Cards Layout**: Information layered over artwork using translucent glass cards with backdrop blur
  - **Top Card (Post Information)**: 20px margin from top/left/right, contains artist name (Instrument Serif 18pt white), class name (Montserrat 12pt rgba(255,255,255,0.7)), timer countdown (Montserrat 14pt white)
  - **Bottom Left Card (Post Stats)**: 20px from bottom/left, contains view count "3 of 5 viewers" (Montserrat 12pt), time remaining "Expires in 18 min" (Montserrat 11pt)
  - **Bottom Right Card (Actions)**: 20px from bottom/right, contains camera icon (24px white), AI feedback icon, comment icon with count, 12px gaps between
- **Vertical Swipe Navigation**: Switch between posts with smooth artwork crossfades behind glass cards (400ms ease-out transitions)
- **Glass Morphism Positioning**: All cards use Primary Glass specs for post info, Secondary Glass specs for stats/actions

#### Camera & Capture Experience (Per UIDesign.md)
- **Full-Screen Viewfinder**: No UI chrome during capture, optional subtle white grid lines
- **Glass Morphism Controls**: Bottom glass card slides up from edge, large 80px centered capture button with subtle shadow
- **Post-Capture Flow**: Artwork displayed full-screen with immediate sharing controls
- **Sharing Controls**: Large glass morphism card centered over artwork with viewer slider and duration selection

### Animation & Interaction Design (Per UIDesign.md - Exact Specifications)
- **Screen Transitions**: 400ms duration with cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) easing, crossfade for artwork backgrounds, slide for overlays
- **Element Animations**: Cards appearing with scale from 0.95 to 1.0 plus opacity fade-in (300ms), button interactions scale to 0.98 (150ms), input focus border color transition (200ms) with subtle scale (1.02)
- **Deletion Animations**: Post expiration with 2-second fade-out plus scale to 0.95, comment removal slide up and fade (300ms), gentle shake animation before deletion
- **Haptic Feedback**: Light impact for button taps/selection changes, medium impact for post creation/successful actions, heavy impact for deletions/errors, selection feedback for slider adjustments
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed only when requested to avoid overwhelming new users
- **Glass Morphism Animations**: Smooth backdrop blur transitions, hover states increase background opacity to 0.25, interactive states with slight scale (0.98) and increased shadow
- **Countdown Animations**: Visual countdown warnings for last 60 seconds with subtle effects, 5-second "undo" option with glass morphism popup after deletion

### Responsive & Accessibility Considerations
- **Mobile-First Design**: All layouts optimized for smartphone usage with thumb-friendly interaction zones
- **Readable Typography**: Font sizes appropriate for viewing artwork details and reading comments comfortably
- **Adequate Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet minimum 44px touch target guidelines
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent spacing, sizing, and color usage to guide user attention naturally

  - **Border Radius**: Screen containers (28px), Primary cards (20px), Secondary cards (16px), Buttons (28px fully rounded)
- **Animation System**: React Native Reanimated for glass morphism transitions, scale animations, and smooth artwork crossfades

### Database Schema Requirements

```sql
-- Class management
classes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  join_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User profiles (simplified for demo)
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  class_id UUID REFERENCES classes(id),
  is_demo_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Artwork posts with ephemeral properties
posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  class_id UUID REFERENCES classes(id),
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,

  max_viewers INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
  view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Peer comments with character limits
comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (length(content) <= 150),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- AI feedback requests and responses
ai_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  feedback_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Photo Capture**: Immediate camera launch (<1 second) with smooth viewfinder performance
- **Image Upload**: Photo processing and upload completion within 3 seconds on typical mobile connections
- **AI Feedback**: GPT-4V analysis and response delivery within 5 seconds of request
- **Real-time Updates**: Comment and interaction updates propagated to all class members within 1 second

### Security & Privacy Considerations
- **Limited Data Collection**: Only essential information stored (name, class association, posts within time limits)
- **Automatic Data Deletion**: All posts and associated data permanently removed after specified duration
- **Class Isolation**: Users can only access content within their assigned class group
- **AI Processing**: Artwork images sent to OpenAI only for users who explicitly request AI feedback

### Demo-Specific Technical Requirements
- **Pre-populated Content**: Seed database with 5 realistic user profiles and 3-4 high-quality artwork posts
- **Realistic Timers**: Set expiration times on demo content to demonstrate ephemeral behavior during demonstrations
- **Comment Examples**: Pre-populate encouraging comments that model the desired supportive tone
- **Single-Device Architecture**: Design data flow to work seamlessly on single device without requiring multiple user accounts

## Open Questions

### User Experience Refinements
1. **Optimal Timer Granularity**: Should countdown displays show minutes/seconds for short durations, or keep format consistent? **Answer**: If it is not too technically difficult I would like a seconds timer.
2. **Comment Notification Strategy**: How should users be notified of new comments on their posts without creating pressure to respond immediately? **Answer**: Don't worry about notifications right now


### Technical Implementation Details
4. **AI Feedback Personalization**: Should AI responses consider user's skill level or previous work, or maintain general encouraging tone? **Answer**: If possible, this can be refined later
5. **Image Quality Optimization**: What's the optimal balance between image quality and upload/storage performance for artwork sharing? **Answer**: To begin with, image quality is not a big deal.
6. **Demo Content Refresh**: How frequently should pre-populated content be updated to maintain realistic feel across multiple demonstrations? **Answer**: How difficult would it be to generate a second set of synthetic data that could be toggled between? Should this be made now or later?

### Future Scalability Considerations
7. **Multi-Class Architecture**: When transitioning from demo to production, how should users handle enrollment in multiple classes? dont worry about it. 
8. **Teacher Feedback Integration**: Should teachers have any visibility into class activity for pedagogical purposes, while maintaining student privacy? don't worry about it. 
9. **Cross-Platform Expansion**: What additional considerations are needed for Android compatibility beyond the initial iOS focus? i want this to be cross platform, but i am developing this on ios and thats the priority

- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tab navigation layout (needs Solo tab addition)
- `components/solo/SoloChat.tsx` - Chat interface component
- `components/solo/ChatMessage.tsx` - Individual chat message component

- `supabase/migrations/20250103000002_solo_demo_seed.sql` - Synthetic demo data

### Notes

- The Solo Tutor uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for multimodal AI responses and text-embedding-3-small for RAG embeddings
- Database uses pgvector extension for vector similarity search
- Image uploads go to Supabase Storage before being sent to AI
- RAG system combines both long-term memory (vector search) and short-term memory (recent messages)

## Codebase Analysis Summary

**✅ What's Actually Implemented (compatible with Draft):**
- Supabase authentication with email/password (✅ works for Draft)
- User registration and login functionality (✅ works for Draft)
- Basic user profile system with username validation (✅ can be simplified)
- Camera functionality with photo capture and upload (✅ works for Draft)
- Supabase Storage integration with photos bucket (✅ works for Draft)
- Basic database migrations for users and photos (✅ foundation works)
- Zustand store for auth state management (✅ works for Draft)
- Basic navigation structure with auth and tabs (✅ structure works)

**🚨 What Needs Major Rework for Draft:**
- **Class Joining Flow**: Current flow has username setup, but Draft needs class code entry after authentication
- **Home Screen**: Current shows demo content, needs class feed with ephemeral posts
- **UI/Typography**: Review UIDesign.md
- **Database Schema**: Missing classes, posts, comments, AI feedback tables
- **Navigation**: Current tabs are "Home" and "Explore", needs "Class Feed" and "Camera"

**🔧 What Needs to be Built from Scratch:**
- Class-based social features (classes, posts, comments)
- Ephemeral content management with timers and auto-deletion
- Feed display with pre-populated demo content

- Sharing controls (viewer limits, duration selection)
- AI feedback integration with OpenAI GPT-4V
- Real-time commenting and interactions
- Demo environment with fake classmates

## 🚨 CRITICAL REWORK REQUIRED

**The existing codebase was built for "VEO Creative Image Messenger" and does NOT match the Draft PRD requirements. Major components need complete rebuilding:**

### **Immediate Priority (Must Fix First):**
1. **Glass Morphism Feed**: Replace traditional card layout with artwork-as-background system
2. **Class Joining Flow**: Add class code entry modal when accessing class feed
3. **Typography**: Replace SpaceMono with Instrument Serif + Montserrat
4. **Design System**: Implement complete glass morphism UI replacing current solid UI
5. **Feed Display**: Build full-screen artwork posts with glass morphism overlay cards

### **Architecture Mismatch:**
- **Current**: Email registration → username setup → group messaging with AI image generation
- **Required**: Email registration → class code entry → ephemeral art sharing with AI feedback

### **Files Requiring Major Updates:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Traditional card layout, needs glass morphism artwork-as-background system
- `app/(auth)/profile-setup.tsx` - Needs simplification for Draft requirements
- `constants/Colors.ts` - Needs glass morphism color specifications
- `components/ThemedText.tsx` - Needs Instrument Serif + Montserrat typography

### **Files That Can Be Reused:**
- `app/(auth)/login.tsx` - Email/password authentication works for Draft
- `app/(auth)/register.tsx` - User registration works for Draft
- `components/auth/AuthForm.tsx` - Email/password form works for Draft

### **Recommended Approach:**
1. **Preserve Authentication**: Keep existing email/password authentication system
2. **Add Class Joining**: Create modal for class code entry when accessing class feed
3. **Rebuild Feed Screen**: Replace demo content with class feed displaying ephemeral posts
4. **Database Migration**: Create new schema for classes, posts, comments while preserving auth tables
5. **Design System**: Implement Draft-specific typography and color scheme from scratch

*This task list prioritizes building a functional, anxiety-reducing ephemeral art sharing platform that demonstrates the value proposition through realistic demo content and smooth, confidence-building interactions.*
