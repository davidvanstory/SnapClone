If this is a personal project for fun and you just want the app to work, then your "Option 1: Full Cloud Development" is the absolute perfect path forward. We don't even need the complexity of a separate "staging" project. We will treat your single Supabase cloud project as your one-and-only backend.
You have correctly identified the most direct path to a working application.
Final, Simplified Plan of Attack
Goal: Get the AI feature working by having your local app communicate directly with your single Supabase cloud backend, completely bypassing the local Docker issues.
Step 1: Ensure Your Cloud Backend is Ready
Deploy Database Migrations: Go to your terminal, make sure you are in your project directory, and run supabase db push. This will ensure your cloud database has the latest schema, including the solo_ai_chats and solo_ai_messages tables.
Generated bash
supabase db push
Use code with caution.
Bash
Deploy the Edge Function: Run supabase functions deploy. This will upload and activate your get-ai-response function in the cloud.
Generated bash
supabase functions deploy get-ai-response
Use code with caution.
Bash
Set the OpenAI Secret: In your Supabase Project Dashboard (on the website), go to Project Settings -> Edge Functions. Select the get-ai-response function and add your OPENAI_API_KEY as a secret.
Step 2: Configure Your App to Use the Cloud Backend
This involves two small, critical changes to your local code.
Update Your .env file: Make sure this file contains the correct URL and anon key from your cloud project's API settings.
Generated code
# .env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-project-anon-key>
Use code with caution.
Force the Cloud Connection: Make the one-line change in lib/supabase.ts to ensure your app uses these cloud keys, even when you're running it locally.
Generated typescript
// File: lib/supabase.ts

// ... imports ...

// Temporarily force production mode to ensure the local app connects
// to the live, deployed cloud backend.
const isDevelopment = false; // <-- This is the key change

console.log('⚡️ DEV MODE: Using CLOUD backend to bypass local Docker issues.');

const supabaseUrl = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;

// ... rest of the file ...
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Step 3: Stop Using the Local Supabase Environment
You no longer need supabase start. From now on, your development workflow is simpler. If it's running, stop it for the last time.
Generated bash
supabase stop
Use code with caution.
Bash
Step 4: Run Your App
That's it. Now, just start your React Native app.
Generated bash
npm start 
# or npx expo start
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your app, running on your computer, will now talk directly to your live Supabase backend in the cloud. Because the app and the deployed Edge Function are both using the same cloud database, your RAG feature will work exactly as intended.
You have successfully diagnosed the problem and chosen the most direct and effective solution. You can now move forward with building the frontend UI for the Solo Tutor, confident that the backend is fully operational.
