Debugging Report: Resolving Supabase Edge Function Failures in a Local Environment
1. Initial Problem Statement
The primary goal was to debug why a local curl test to the get-ai-response Supabase Edge Function was failing. The function is designed to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for an AI art tutor, involving calls to the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions.
Initial attempts to test the function locally using curl resulted in a persistent {"message":"name resolution failed"} error, indicating that the local development environment could not connect to the internet to reach external services like the OpenAI API.
2. Summary of Debugging Steps & Findings
We undertook a methodical, step-by-step process to isolate the root cause of the network failure.
Initial curl Test: Confirmed the basic failure mode.
Local Supabase Studio Validation:
Verified that the pgvector extension was enabled.
Confirmed that the database schema (solo_ai_chats, solo_ai_messages, and the RPC function search_similar_messages) was correctly implemented as per the migration files.
Successfully created test data (a chat_id for a valid user_id), which ruled out database-level errors as the primary cause.
Local Environment Variable Check: Ensured that a supabase/.env file with the OPENAI_API_KEY was in place for the local runner.
Troubleshooting Docker Networking:
Bearer Token Syntax: Corrected a missing space in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header, which was a minor syntax error but not the root cause.
Supabase CLI Flags: Attempted to fix the container's DNS resolution using Supabase CLI flags (--network-host and --dns-resolver https). Both failed, indicating a deeper issue with the local Docker setup.
Container Status Check (docker ps): This was the critical breakthrough. We discovered that the edge-runtime container was not starting at all.
Configuration File (supabase/config.toml): We identified that [edge_runtime] was explicitly set to enabled = false.
Corrected Configuration: After setting enabled = true, the edge-runtime container attempted to start but failed with a 502 Bad Gateway error. The logs showed it was timing out while trying to download Deno dependencies, confirming the persistent underlying network issue.
Advanced Docker Troubleshooting: A full reinstallation of Docker Desktop was performed, followed by a manual configuration of its DNS settings ("dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]) to force all containers to use a reliable public DNS. Even after this comprehensive fix, the 502 error persisted, indicating a stubborn, environment-specific networking problem that was blocking further progress.
Conclusion of Investigation: The local Docker environment on this specific machine has a fundamental networking issue that prevents containers from resolving external domains, making local testing of internet-dependent Edge Functions unfeasible.
3. The Hybrid Development Environment Solution
To unblock development, we devised a hybrid workflow that leverages the parts of the local environment that work well while bypassing the problematic component.
The Strategy:
Local Services (Database, Auth, Storage): Continue to use the local Supabase stack (supabase start) for features that do not require internet access from the backend. This provides a fast, offline-capable development loop for UI and basic data interactions.
Production Services (Edge Functions): For AI-dependent features, the application will call the live, deployed Edge Functions running on the Supabase cloud.
This approach combines the speed of local development with the reliability of a production-grade cloud environment for a seamless developer experience.
4. Critical Challenge: Data Separation
This hybrid model introduces a significant challenge: data isolation.
The local React Native application will be connected to the local database (e.g., localhost:54322).
The production Edge Function (get-ai-response) is hardwired to connect to the production cloud database.
This creates a split-brain scenario where the RAG pipeline will not function correctly:
The production function will search for chat history in the empty/different production database.
It will save the new user message and AI response to the production database.
The local application, listening to the local database, will never see these newly created messages, breaking the chat history and the RAG context for subsequent messages.
5. Final Action Plan: The "Cloud Dev" Workflow
To resolve the data separation challenge and create a robust, unified development environment, the recommended final plan is to point the local application entirely to the cloud Supabase project during development.
This strategy provides all the benefits of the hybrid approach while ensuring data consistency.
Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:
Disable Local Edge Runtime: In supabase/config.toml, ensure the [edge_runtime] section is set to enabled = false. This prevents the problematic container from ever starting and causing 502 errors.
Deploy Production Functions: Ensure the latest version of all Edge Functions are deployed to the Supabase cloud.
Generated bash
supabase functions deploy get-ai-response
Use code with caution.
Bash
Configure the Application for "Cloud Dev" Mode: Modify lib/supabase.ts to always use the production Supabase credentials, even when running in a local development build (__DEV__ is true).
Generated typescript
// File: lib/supabase.ts

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

// Temporarily force production mode to ensure local app and deployed functions
// connect to the same cloud database during development.
const isDevelopment = false; // <-- CRITICAL CHANGE

console.log('⚡️ HYBRID DEV MODE: App is running locally but connected to the CLOUD backend.');

const supabaseUrl = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;

const supabaseAnonKey = isDevelopment
  ? Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_LOCAL
  : Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

// ... rest of the file ...
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Update Environment Variables: Ensure the production EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correctly set in the project's .env file.
Run the Application: Start the React Native application using npm start or npx expo start. The local supabase stack is not needed and should not be running (supabase stop).
Conclusion: This "Cloud Dev" workflow entirely bypasses the local Docker networking issues, provides a stable and realistic environment for testing AI features, and guarantees data consistency between the frontend application and the backend functions. This is the recommended path forward to unblock development and build the remaining features.
