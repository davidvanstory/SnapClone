    - [ ] To ensure a functional RAG demo, the embeddings for this historical data **must be pre-computed and included in the seed file**.
    - [ ] This will be accomplished by running a one-time local script to call the OpenAI embedding API for all demo message texts, and then pasting the resulting vectors directly into the `INSERT` statements in the SQL migration file. This avoids slow and unreliable API calls during the database migration process itself.



To have a functional and impressive RAG demo, we must have real, pre-computed embeddings in our seed file. This is the professional way to do it.
Here is the plan:
Step 1: Create a One-Off Script to Generate the Embeddings
We will write a very simple, standalone script (e.g., generate_seed_embeddings.mjs) that you will run once on your local machine. This script is not part of the main app.
The script will:
Take the text content of all 12 demo messages.
Make 12 API calls to the OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model.
Print the resulting 1536-dimension vectors to your console.
Step 2: Copy and Paste the Embeddings into Your Migration File
You will then copy the output from that script and paste it directly into your ..._solo_tutor_seed.sql migration file. The INSERT statements will look something like this (shortened for brevity):

Generated sql
INSERT INTO public.solo_ai_messages (chat_id, role, content, embedding, created_at) VALUES 
(
  '20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 
  'user', 
  'I''m really struggling with drawing hands...',
  '[-0.0123, 0.0456, ..., -0.0789]', -- <-- This is the real, pasted embedding
  NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'
);
