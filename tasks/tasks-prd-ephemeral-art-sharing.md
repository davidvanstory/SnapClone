# Draft (EphemeralArt) - Task List
**Based on PRD**: `prd-ephemeral-art-sharing.md`

---

## Codebase Analysis Summary

**âœ… What's Actually Implemented (compatible with Draft):**
- Supabase authentication with email/password (âœ… works for Draft)
- User registration and login functionality (âœ… works for Draft)
- Basic user profile system with username validation (âœ… can be simplified)
- Camera functionality with photo capture and upload (âœ… works for Draft)
- Supabase Storage integration with photos bucket (âœ… works for Draft)
- Basic database migrations for users and photos (âœ… foundation works)
- Zustand store for auth state management (âœ… works for Draft)
- Basic navigation structure with auth and tabs (âœ… structure works)

**ðŸš¨ What Needs Major Rework for Draft:**
- **Class Joining Flow**: Current flow has username setup, but Draft needs class code entry after authentication
- **Home Screen**: Current shows demo content, needs class feed with ephemeral posts
- **UI/Typography**: Review UIDesign.md
- **Database Schema**: Missing classes, posts, comments, AI feedback tables
- **Navigation**: Current tabs are "Home" and "Explore", needs "Class Feed" and "Camera"

**ðŸ”§ What Needs to be Built from Scratch:**
- Class-based social features (classes, posts, comments)
- Ephemeral content management with timers and auto-deletion
- Feed display with pre-populated demo content
- Frame selection system for artwork
- Sharing controls (viewer limits, duration selection)
- AI feedback integration with OpenAI GPT-4V
- Real-time commenting and interactions
- Demo environment with fake classmates

- **Phase 2** : Implement tasks 5.0-6.0 for social features and AI integration  
- **Phase 3** : Build tasks 7.0-8.0 for ephemeral features and demo content
- **Phase 4** : Polish with tasks 9.0-10.0 for production-ready experience

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Maintain single-device testing approach with pre-populated content

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REWORK REQUIRED

**The existing codebase was built for "VEO Creative Image Messenger" and does NOT match the Draft PRD requirements. Major components need complete rebuilding:**

### **Immediate Priority (Must Fix First):**
1. **Class Joining Flow**: Add class code entry modal when accessing class feed
2. **Home Screen**: Replace demo content with class feed displaying ephemeral posts
3. **Navigation**: Change tabs from "Home"/"Explore" to "Class Feed"/"Camera"  
4. **Typography**: Replace SpaceMono with Instrument Serif + Montserrat
5. **Database Schema**: Add classes, posts, comments, AI feedback tables

### **Architecture Mismatch:**
- **Current**: Email registration â†’ username setup â†’ group messaging with AI image generation
- **Required**: Email registration â†’ class code entry â†’ ephemeral art sharing with AI feedback

### **Files Requiring Major Updates:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Wrong home screen content, needs class feed
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Wrong tab names and icons
- `app/(auth)/profile-setup.tsx` - Needs simplification for Draft requirements

### **Files That Can Be Reused:**
- `app/(auth)/login.tsx` - Email/password authentication works for Draft
- `app/(auth)/register.tsx` - User registration works for Draft
- `components/auth/AuthForm.tsx` - Email/password form works for Draft

### **Recommended Approach:**
1. **Preserve Authentication**: Keep existing email/password authentication system
2. **Add Class Joining**: Create modal for class code entry when accessing class feed
3. **Rebuild Feed Screen**: Replace demo content with class feed displaying ephemeral posts
4. **Database Migration**: Create new schema for classes, posts, comments while preserving auth tables
5. **Design System**: Implement Draft-specific typography and color scheme from scratch

*This task list prioritizes building a functional, anxiety-reducing ephemeral art sharing platform that demonstrates the value proposition through realistic demo content and smooth, confidence-building interactions.*
