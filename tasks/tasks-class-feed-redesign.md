# Tasks: Class Feed Chat-Style Redesign

## Relevant Files

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Main class feed screen that needs complete UI redesign from full-screen to chat-style ‚úÖ
- `components/feed/ArtworkCard.tsx` - New component for individual artwork cards with metadata ‚úÖ
- `components/feed/ClassFeedHeader.tsx` - New fixed header component with class name ‚úÖ
- `components/feed/ClassFeedList.tsx` - New scrollable list container for artwork cards ‚úÖ
- `store/classStore.ts` - May need updates for new feed interaction patterns and scroll-to-post functionality
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Ensure post data structure supports new card layout requirements

### Notes

- Redesigns class feed from full-screen artwork backgrounds to chat-style vertical feed
- Uses glass morphism design system from UIDesign.md with primary and secondary glass cards
- Art cards are 60% screen width with fixed aspect ratio for consistency
- Tight, cohesive card design with no dead space between artwork and metadata
- Fixed class name header that stays visible during scrolling
- Clean white background instead of dynamic artwork backgrounds
- Supports both Juni-shared and camera-captured artwork
- Sets foundation for better social interaction and Juni integration
- **IMPORTANT**: This redesign is a prerequisite for the Juni Share with Class feature, which needs scroll-to-post functionality
